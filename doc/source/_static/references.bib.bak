  abstract = {The highly integrated Zumo 32U4 is our newest Zumo robot. Enhancements over the older Zumo robot for Arduino include a built-in Arduino-compatible ATmega32U4 microcontroller, an LCD, encoders for closed-loop motor control, and proximity sensors for obstacle detection. The robot is compact enough to qualify as a mini sumo robot, but it’s high-performance motors and integrated sensors make it versatile enough to serve as a general-purpose small robot.},

  abstract = {The Pololu Zumo 32U4 robot is a versatile tracked robot based on the Arduino-compatible ATmega32U4 MCU. It includes two 100:1 HP micro metal gearmotors along with integrated dual motor drivers, an LCD, quadrature encoders, line sensors, side and front proximity sensors for detecting objects, and a full IMU for detecting impacts and tracking orientation. The low-profile robot is less than 10 cm × 10 cm—small enough to qualify for Mini Sumo. No soldering or assembly is required; just add 4 AA batteries and a USB cable and your Zumo is ready for programming.},

The device can drive one DC motor or other devices like solenoids. The output driver block  consists of N-channel power MOSFET’s configured as an H-bridge to drive the motor winding. An internal charge pump generates needed gate drive voltages.},
